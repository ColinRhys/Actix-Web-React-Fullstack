# Actix-web-React-FullStack

Fullstack website using Actix-web and React

I created this project for a few reasons. I wanted to create a template for any future side projects I make. I also wanted to get a feel for some technologies I find really cool but have not used before. Actix-web and Auth0. I also have mostly been a backend developer and so wanted to work with being a full stack development.

App have been dockerized can run with "docker-compose up"

Still some things to finish up

General Code Cleanup <br>
More comments in the code so that I can always remember what I did and why. <br>
