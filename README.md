# Actix-web-React-FullStack

Fullstack website using Actix-web and React

I created this project for a few reasons. I wanted to create a template for any future side projects I make. I also wanted to get a feel for some technologies I find really cool but have not used before. Actix-web and Auth0. I also have mostly been a backend developer and so wanted to work with being a full stack development.

App have been dockerized can run with "docker-compose up"

Still some things to finish up:

Write up: <br>
- Auth0 <br>
  - Rule for permissions / role on user sign up <br>

General Code Cleanup <br>
More comments in the code so that I can always remember what I did and why. <br>
Better write up of the project here <br>
All routes in frontend being called correct way <br>
Tests <br>
- Frontend <br>
- Backend <br>
